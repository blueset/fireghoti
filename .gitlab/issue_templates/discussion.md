<!--
	Please tell us how do you want to implement your idea.
	As noted in the contribution guidelines, there is a good chance that your
	merge request will not be merged if there is no agreement with the project maintainers.
	However, we are currently so understaffed that it is virtually impossible to
	respond to every single proposal. So, feel free to implement it if there is no response
	for more than a week or there is a thumbs-up emoji reaction from the project maintainer(s).

	Many thanks for your involvement!
