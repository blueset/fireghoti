## What type of refactoring is this?
<!-- If this happens on your device and has to do with the user interface, it's client-side. If this happens on either with the API or the backend, or you got a server-side error in the client, it's server-side. -->

## Contribution Guidelines
By submitting this issue, you agree to follow our [Contribution Guidelines](https://firefish.dev/firefish/firefish/-/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTING.md)
- [ ] I agree to follow this project's Contribution Guidelines
- [ ] I have searched the issue tracker for similar requests, and this is not a duplicate.

## Are you willing to refactor the code? (optional)
- [ ] Yes, I will open a merge request that closes this ticket.

<!--
	Please tell us how to refactor the code.
	As noted in the contribution guidelines, there is a good chance that your
	merge request will not be merged if there is no agreement with the project maintainers.
	However, we are currently so understaffed that it is virtually impossible to
	respond to every single proposal. So, feel free to implement it if there is no response
	for more than a week or there is a thumbs-up emoji reaction from the project maintainer(s).

	Many thanks for your involvement!
