## Unreleased

- Fix bugs

## [v20240516](https://firefish.dev/firefish/firefish/-/merge_requests/10854/commits)

- Improve timeline UX (you can restore the original appearance by settings)
- Remove `$[center]` MFM function
	- This function was suddenly added last year (https://firefish.dev/firefish/firefish/-/commit/1a971efa689323d54eebb4d3646e102fb4d1d95a), but according to the [MFM spec](https://github.com/misskey-dev/mfm.js/blob/6aaf68089023c6adebe44123eebbc4dcd75955e0/docs/syntax.md#fn), `$[something]` must be an inline element (while `center` is a block element), so such a syntax is not expected by MFM renderers. Please use `<center></center>` instead.
